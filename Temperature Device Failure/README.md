# Temperature Device Failure
In this project, we analyzed the historic data for device performance of heat sensors and categorized them into four types: weekday day, weekday night, weekend day, and weekend night. We then used the best K-means value to predict the clusters and performed Gaussian distribution (EllipticEnvelope) to detect anomalies. Finally, we plotted the results to identify the temperature range where device failures occur. 

# Goal
To analyze historic heat sensor data and identify performance patterns to prevent device failure.
