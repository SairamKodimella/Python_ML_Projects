# Telecom Customer Churn

# Introduction
In this project I analysed telecom customer data using Python, Seaborn, Matplotlib, and NumPy. 
I developed and compared several machine learning models, including Random Forest, XG Boost, Naive Bayes, and Logistic Regression, 
and compared them to identify the most effective model for this dataset.
