# Employee Turnover Analysis

In this project, we utilized the HR data and performed various data analysis techniques, 
such as data cleaning, data processing, and Exploratory data analysis using pandas, seaborn, matplotlib.
We then developed machine learning models and compared the accuracy of the models to identify the best one for the given dataset.

# Goal 
- To understand what factors contributed most to employee turnover.
- To perform clustering to find any meaningful patterns of employee traits.
- To create a model that predicts the likelihood if a certain employee will leave the company or not.
- To create or improve different retention strategies on targeted employees.
