# ### Objective: 
# - To understand what factors contributed most to employee turnover.
# 
# - To perform clustering to find any meaningful patterns of employee traits.
# 
# - To create a model that predicts the likelihood if a certain employee will leave the company or not. 
# 
# - To create or improve different retention strategies on targeted employees. 
# 
# The implementation of this model will allow management to create better decision-making actions.
#

# 2. Predictive Analytics - What might happen?
# 3. Prescriptive Analytics - What should we do?

# ### The Problem:
# 
# One of the most common problems at work is **turnover.** 
# 
# Replacing a worker earning about **50,000 dollars** cost the company about **10,000 dollars** or 20% of that workerâ€™s yearly income according to the Center of American Progress.
# 
# Replacing a high-level employee can cost multiple of that...
# 
# **Cost include:**
# - Cost of off-boarding 
# - Cost of hiring (advertising, interviewing, hiring)
# - Cost of onboarding a new person (training, management time)
# - Lost productivity (a new person may take 1-2 years to reach the productivity of an existing person)
# 
# **Annual Cost of Turnover** = (Hiring + Onboarding + Development + Unfilled Time) * (# Employees x Annual Turnover Percentage)
# 
# **Annual Cost of Turnover** = (1,000 + 500) x (15,000 * 24%)
# 
# **Annual Cost of Turnover)** = 1500 x 3600
# 
# **Annual Cost of Turnover)** = 5400000
# 

# ## Example
# 
# 1. Jobs (earning under 30k a year): the cost to replace a 10/hour retail employee would be **3,328 dollars**.
# 2. Jobs (earning 30k-50k a year) - the cost to replace a 40k manager would be **8,000 dollars**.
# 3. Jobs of executives (earning 100k+ a year) - the cost to replace a 100k CEO is **213,000 dollars**.

# ## Satisfaction VS Evaluation
# 
# - There are **3** distinct clusters for employees who left the company
#  
# **Cluster 1 (Hard-working and Sad Employee):** Satisfaction was below 0.2 and evaluations were greater than 0.75. Which could be a good indication that employees who left the company were good workers but felt horrible at their job. 
#  - **Question:** What could be the reason for feeling so horrible when you are highly evaluated? Could it be working too hard? Could this cluster mean employees who are "overworked"?
# 
# **Cluster 2 (Bad and Sad Employee):** Satisfaction between about 0.35~0.45 and evaluations below ~0.58. This could be seen as employees who were badly evaluated and felt bad at work.
#  - **Question:** Could this cluster mean employees who "under-performed"?
# 
# **Cluster 3 (Hard-working and Happy Employee):** Satisfaction between 0.7~1.0 and evaluations were greater than 0.8. Which could mean that employees in this cluster were "ideal". They loved their work and were evaluated highly for their performance. 
#  - **Question:** Could this cluser mean that employees left because they found another job opportunity?

# # What to Optimize
# 
# We want our machine learn model to capture as much of the minority class as possible (turnover group). Our objective is to catch ALL of the highly probable turnover employee at the risk of flagging some low-risk non-turnover employee. 

# ## Conclusion
# **Binary Classification**: Turnover V.S. Non Turnover
# 
# **Instance Scoring**: Likelihood of employee responding to an offer/incentive to save them from leaving.
# 
# **Need for Application**: Save employees from leaving
# 
# In our employee retention problem, rather than simply predicting whether an employee will leave the company within a certain time frame, we would much rather have an estimate of the probability that he/she will leave the company. 
# We would rank employees by their probability of leaving, then allocate a limited incentive budget to the highest probability instances. 
# 
# Consider employee turnover domain where an employee is given treatment by Human  Resources because they think the employee will leave the company within a month, but the employee actually does not. This is a false positive. This mistake could be expensive, inconvenient, and time consuming for both the Human Resources and employee, but is a good investment for relational growth. 
# 
# Compare this with the opposite error, where Human Resources does not give treatment/incentives to the employees and they do leave. This is a false negative. This type of error is more detrimental because the company lost an employee, which could lead to great setbacks and more money to rehire. 
# Depending on these errors, different costs are weighed based on the type of employee being treated. For example, if itâ€™s a high-salary employee then would we need a costlier form of treatment? What if itâ€™s a low-salary employee? The cost for each error is different and should be weighed accordingly. 
#  
#  **Solution 1:** 
#  - We can rank employees by their probability of leaving, then allocate a limited incentive budget to the highest probability instances.
#  - OR, we can allocate our incentive budget to the instances with the highest expected loss, for which we'll need the probability of turnover.
# 
# **Solution 2:** 
# Develop learning programs for managers. Then use analytics to gauge their performance and measure progress. Some advice:
#  - Be a good coach
#  - Empower the team and do not micromanage
#  - Express interest for team member success
#  - Have clear vision / strategy for team
#  - Help team with career development    

# # Selection Bias
# ***
# 
# - One thing to note about this dataset is the turnover feature. We don't know if the employees that left are interns, contractors, full-time, or part-time. These are important variables to take into consideration when performing a machine learning algorithm to it. 
# 
# - Another thing to note down is the type of bias of the evaluation feature. Evaluation is heavily subjective, and can vary tremendously depending on who is the evaluator. If the employee knows the evaluator, then he/she will probably have a higher score.
