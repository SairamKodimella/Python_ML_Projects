# Indian Life Prediction
This is my first academic project in my Masters in Data Science. This helped me learn through differnet libraries in python like pandas, seaborn , matplotlib  to perform Data cleaning and Exploratory data analysis 
. In this project we analysed the data of Indian citizens from the dataset found in Kaggle and analysed what are the key factors effecting the life expectancy rate in India.
