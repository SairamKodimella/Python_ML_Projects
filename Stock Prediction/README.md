# Stock Prediction Using Machine Learning Models

In this project, we collected historical data of the Cognizant company stock from Yahoo Finance and performed data processing. We then trained machine learning models to draw a graph for the 50-day moving average and 200-day moving average of the stock. By doing so, we aimed to gain insights into the trends and patterns of the Cognizant stock over time.
